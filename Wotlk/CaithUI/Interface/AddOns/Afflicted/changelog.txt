    * Fixed the spellID showing when a custom spell is added by spellID
    * Fixed /afflicted test not checking the redirected anchor to see if it's enabled or disabled
    * Removed a dontFade check on UnitDied for icon display, the only thing that will remain is cooldowns when someone dies
    * Updated a bunch of libraries

    * Changed the way cooldowns show up visually, if their shown in their own anchor it won't display [CD] next to them, but if you redirect them to another anchor it will append [CD] like normal

    * Trying out a new profile feature, you can set specific profiles to use in different arenas, meaning you can set different spells to be used, you cannot however switch between bar and icon style depending on arena.
    * Will only process debuffs now, since those are all we care about instead of buffs as well
    * Removed the name trigger limit, because we catch timers based on success will always only trigger one so no Shadowstep types of issues
    * Changed the messages to be more generic, we only use one trigger/fade message now, if you want specific messages based on buff type do it by anchor then
    * Updated GTB to fix callback issues
    * Added Blade Flurry, Adrenaline Rush, Devour Magic to spell list, all disabled by default

    * Added Flame/Frost Shock because they are the same cooldowns as Earth Shock
