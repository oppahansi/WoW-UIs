Change Log

TODO:
- Fix ColorPicker to not callback twice on Okay when opacity is enabled
- Allow for sub categories

v1.21
- Fixed text value insertion

v1.2
- Fixed bug with empty Windows
- Added more robust text value insertion, handling %.2f for example
- Added optionSetTable.about = false to opt out of the about panel
- Added ChangeLog.txt

v1.1
- Added CONTROLTYPE_WINDOW for child frame control windows (optionally scrollable)
- Modified Scrollbars to be inside the window, have a border, and still be scrollable while moused over
Window width is now modified depending on the visibility of the scrollbar.
- Renamed UpdateTextWrap to UpdateBox and it is now called on child controls when the window scroll box is changed
- Fixed an error with dropdown entry selection
- Modified SetRelativePoint for better extensibility:
Added xOffset and yOffset fields for modifying the default offset from the anchor control.
Added xOffsetRelative and yOffsetRelative fields for modifying the default offset of relatively anchored controls.
xOffset and xOffsetRelative are also used in calculating the default width for windows.

v1.0
- Added CONTROLTYPE_EDITBOX
- Removed isTemp  and replaced it with isGUI which is only a passthrough value to the callback; text and saved var are still updated. 
It is now: callback(value, isGUI, isUpdate)
isGUI is now passed as true for all GUI control interactions (but not for the Okay, Cancel and Default blizzard option panel buttons). 
- Added control:Refresh() called when the blizzard options frame is shown
- Added control:Okay(), control:Cancel() and control:Reset() that are called for each control that has them when you click the blizzard interface buttons
- Fixed Cancel to correctly revert values/controls to their previous state. Doesn't pass isGUI.
